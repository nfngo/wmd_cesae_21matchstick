# wmd_cesae_21matchstick

## 21 matchstick game developed with Java

This project was developed as a task for CESAE's Web & Mobile Development Course.

The main goal was to write a program for a matchstick game being played betwwen the computer and a user or between two users.

There are two difficulties when playing vs computer. The begginer level, where cpu plays randomly, and the advanced level, where cpu plays to win if it's possible (whoever is forced to pick up the last matchstick loses the game).

PS: "Code" and Comments in Portuguese
